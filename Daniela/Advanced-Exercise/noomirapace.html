        <h3>Early life </h3>
        <p>Rapace in Los Angeles, 2015 Rapace was born in Hudiksvall, Sweden. Her mother, Nina Norén (born Kristina Norén; 1954), is a Swedish actress, and her father, Rogelio Durán (10 November 1953 - 4 November 2006), was a Spanish flamenco singer from
            Badajoz.[3] She has said her father may have been of part Romani descent, and though she is "not sure if it is true," she has "always been interested in the culture."[4][5] Rapace's sister, Særún Norén, is a photographer.[6] Rapace has said
            she saw her father only occasionally before his death. At age five, she moved from her native Sweden to Flúðir in Iceland with her mother and stepfather, Hrafnkell Karlsson. Two years later, she made her film debut in a minor role in the Icelandic
            film In the Shadow of the Raven, along with Hrafnkell.[7] Rapace speaks fluent Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian and English, in addition to her native Swedish.[7]</p>

        <h3>Early work</h3>
        <p>
            At the age of seven, Rapace was given her first film role, a non-speaking part in the Icelandic film In the Shadow of the Raven by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson. This experience prompted her to be an actress.[8] She left home at age 15 and enrolled in a Stockholm
            theatre school.[9] In 1996, Rapace made her television debut playing the part of Lucinda Gonzales in the long-running soap series Tre kronor. From 1998 to 1999, Rapace studied at the acting school Skara Skolscen.[10] She has been engaged at
            Theater Plaza in 2000–01,[10] Orionteatern in 2001,[11] Teater Galeasen in 2002,[10] Stockholms stadsteater in 2003,[10] as well as at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, all in Stockholm.[12] In 2007, she won acclaim for her award-winning portrayal
            of a troubled teen mother in the Danish film Daisy Diamond, directed by Simon Staho. She won the two top film awards in Denmark (the Bodil and Robert prize) for Best Actress for her role in the film, which was also selected for the main competition
            at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. The film received some criticism for the supposed abuse occurring to a baby actor during production.[13] In 2009, she played the role of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish-produced film adaptation
            of Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for which she won the Guldbagge Award (Sweden's top film award),[14] and was nominated for a BAFTA Award[15] and European Film Award.[16] She later appeared in the same
            role in the sequels The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. All three films were subsequently recut as a six-part miniseries aired on Swedish television called Millennium, for which Rapace received a nomination
            for the International Emmy Award for Best Actress.[17] The three film adaptations have earned over $200 million at the box office worldwide.[18]</p>
